    byte-->short-->int--->long--->float-->double
            char

now the float is 32 bit and long is 64 bit but still the float can store wide range of values that is not integer values as well
it might face a loss in precision
int can be converted to long and long can be converted into float

2.explicit conversion or narrowing conversion

    converting double to int and converting char to int

By default, the floating number is treated as which datatype? double
